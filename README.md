# JSON to TEXT Convertor

This is a Python code that helps to convert all .json files in a particular folder to .txt files and saves the .txt files in same folder with same name.

* Make sure all the .json files are in one folder
* .txt will be stored in same folder after conversion
* Every line as commands which will help you understand working of every line of code
# Why I made this Code
I was facing this problem in one of my projects (Detection of Gingiva Phenotype using Deep Learning) in which I was using the YOLOv5 Model for training my model, which takes .txt file as label input. But when I hand-annotated my images using lableMe, it stored labeled data as a .json file, that's why I made this code.
